      "Product Review: I am completely in love with this device...my skin looks seriously flawless after less than 2 weeks use. I wasnt going to write a review this soon, but I am just that impressed and it has made a difference very quickly. I havent had major acne or anything, but I do have clogged pores and some hyper pigmentation on my temples. I have normal to combination skin. Because I use chemical exfoliants (most recently the Drunk Elephant TLC Glycolic Night Serum with BHA & AHA) I felt like using a Clarisonic would be too aggressive on my skin and overexfoliate. So when I read a ton of good reviews and watched a video on YouTube of a Beautypedia review of this product (check it out, it has some helpful info...they say it doesnt matter which device you get the $99 or $169 one the results are the same) I had to try it since it supposed to be gentler on your skin than the Clarisonic. I was VERY skeptical it would work, and actually thought the silicone bristles would actually impact my pores and make them more clogged. I was impressed after the first use. My face was super soft and it did bring up some of the gunk that had been in my pores that my BHA could not get out. Really impressive because I swear by chemical exfoliants. Initially the first few days my skin did go through a minor purging period where it was bringing up debris from my pores that had been deep in my skin. But after those few days my skin is literally glowing. I have seen the edges around my dark spots start to fade because I believe it helps my serum and other treatments sink in deeper than they normally would. I even use it around my eyes which usually get drier than the rest of my face and my makeup settles into my squinting lines under my eyes. After using this for almost two weeks my eyes look much smoother with makeup on mainly because I think my moisturizer and serum is able to penetrate deeper. I noticed last night that I had a milia bump by my eye (a stubborn little whitehead that are impossible to get fid of) and it is completely gone! I am still able to use my Drunk Elephant Glycolic Serum with no problems or sensitivity. This is very gentle, I dont feel like I am scrubbing off my face. I do only use it at night though. It is very easy to use and keep clean. The way it is made it fits easily into your palm and can get into the crevices of your face and around and under your eyes. It feels nice to use, I even have my hubby using it also! I cant compare it to the Clarisonic but just because this is a gentle cleansing device it packs a mighty punch in getting your face cleaner than you have ever seen, seriously. Sorry for the long review, but this is an investment you should research before buying so I hope this was helpful! This little gem was worth every penny!\n",
