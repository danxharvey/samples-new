sample of deep learning coding for research purposes

yesnaby_005.mp4 represents an opportunistic testing of a model trained on computer generated images
against real world conditions featuring artifects never before seen by the model such as:

clouds, rain, reflective surfaces, puddles, low winter sun excessively scattering light

The model held up quite well and informed future research developments for the computer generated graphics.
