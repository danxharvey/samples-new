sample of deep learning coding for research purposes

yesnaby_005.mp4 represents an opportunistic testing of a model trained on computer generated images
against real world conditions featuring artifects never before seen by the model such as:

  - clouds
  - rain
  - reflective surfaces
  - puddles
  - cliff top scenarios
  - low winter sun excessively scattering light
  - the real world

Whilst the results may appear patchy, the segmentation and depth sensing were able to track the vehicle
whilst showing it could differentiate between land and sky. It was interesting to note that the model
could recognise sky being reflected in the puddles despite having never seen a puddle before.
However it did naively assume that the sky must be far away.
